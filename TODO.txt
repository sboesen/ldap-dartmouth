TODO: Create models for search_results and search_errors.
On update for any Group record, run new search. (should only run on name being
changed)
Then just have partials for search_results and search_errors.

one condition that will be tough to handle: In GroupSearcherWorker or whatever
it's called, if there's more than one group, how do you handle that? I
think... what I'll do it create a new Group for that under search... in the
worker.
